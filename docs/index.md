# Daniel Chu: A Real Person

This is my personal website in which I try to prove that I am a real person with real skills and abilities.

## About Daniel
I am a real person. 

## Experience Daniel
- My [CV](cv.md) contains information on my education, experience, and publications. Alternatively, my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CJHkAy0AAAAJ) can attest that I am a real person with real publications.
- All of the software I have produced or manage can be found at my [Github profile](https://github.com/catcrumpet/).
- I also have a [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-chu-horse/).

## Communicate with Daniel
Email: <danielchu@danielchu.horse>

I try to respond to all emails that fall under one or more of the following categories:

- Job opportunities.
- Academic collaborations.
- PDF fulltext requests for any of the published articles listed in my CV.
- Questions regarding the theoretical underpinnings of any of the software I have written. Please use Github for any technical questions or comments.

Emails that include any of the following attributes listed below may elicit a response from me but the probability is low.

- Complaints from one of my past students like that one undergraduate who anonymously wrote two paragraphs laden with invective for my course evaluation.
- Requests to submit manuscripts to shady journals with very long names.
- Anything from Anthony Lloyd Weber, composer of the musical *Cats*.
